Greek-lish to Greek and vice versa translator.

What is  Greek-lish?

Greek-lish is the act of writting Greek using latin characters instead of Greek ones. The name derives from merging the Greek word with Eng - lish, hence Greek-lish.

Example : '' O Vagelhs shmera egrapse kwdika '' would translate to Greek as '' Ο Βαγγελης σημερα εγραψε κωδικα ''  ( This translates to english as : 'Vagelis wrote code today' )

This programma translates a given string as shown above and can also translate a string given in Greek into Greek-lish.
